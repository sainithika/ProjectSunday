     box-model properties.

   ▫ Then go ahead with creating another div with class name as section
   ▫ This Div of class section should have h4 element, paragaph elements
     and an anchor tag this anchor tag should redirect this user to this site
     "https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp".
   ▫ Give this Div that is of class section a styling like you see on output
     like background-color, border-radius and Style only the even p tags immediately
     after h4. (Just like you see on Output web)
   ▫ Apply styling to anchor tag that is the anchor tag should have a different
     color based on its state, Using Pseudo-class Selectors apply the styling.

   ▫ Now, use hr tag to add that horizontal line.
   ▫ Create another div of class content, This div contains an h4 element and
     a paragaph element (Refer the output website...)
   ▫ Again Create another div of class section, this div contains h4 element
     and another div that is of class code.

     📝Note: Pre tag <pre> </pre> will preserve the white spaces
     i.e., white spaces will not be ignored. and using code tag <code></code>
     we can render code.

   ▫ To this code div give it a border as you can see on output website.
   ▫ Then Create an anchor tag that should be outside the code div and inside
     the section div, this anchor tag should navigate user to this web site 
     "https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default" go
     ahead and apply Pseudo-class selectors just like you
     did for the previous anchor tag.

     properties and also when we hover over h5 element the color of element should
     change to the color as you can see on the output website.
